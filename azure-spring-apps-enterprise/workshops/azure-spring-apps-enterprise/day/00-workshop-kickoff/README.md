# 00 - Workshop Kickoff

Please check with the workshop moderator if this step has already been configured and completed for you.

## Create Azure Account for the workshop

To start the workshop, you need to have an Azure account with active subscription. If this is not provided by your company, please sign-up for a free Azure account which gives you $100 worth of free credit per month. Free account can be created by visiting [Microsoft Azure Pass](https://www.microsoftazurepass.com/)

As part of the workshop you will be provided a __Promo Code__ which gives $100 worth of free credits. Please make sure you enter the __Promo Code__ when you sign up for the new Azure account.

Once the account is created, please forward your `subscription id` to the workshop moderator. They will ensure the background processing is completed for you to go ahead and start using the subscription.

Subscription id can be accessed as below
 - Login to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
 - In the search bar, type the keyword `Subscriptions`. This should pull up your subscription.
