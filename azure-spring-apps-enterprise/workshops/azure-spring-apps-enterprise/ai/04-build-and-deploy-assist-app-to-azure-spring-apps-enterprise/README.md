# Build and deploy assist app to Azure Spring Apps Enterprise

1. Set both standard and AI environment variables, e.g. 

   ```bash
   source ./azure-spring-apps-enterprise/scripts/setup-ai-env-variables.sh
   source ./azure-spring-apps-enterprise/scripts/setup-env-variables.sh
   ```

1. Create an application placeholder for the new AI service `assist-service`, e.g.

    ```bash
    az spring app create \
      --service ${SPRING_APPS_SERVICE} \
      --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
      --name ${AI_APP} \
      --instance-count 1 \
      --memory 1Gi
    ```

1.  Configure Spring Cloud Gateway with the `assist-service` routes, e.g.

    ```bash
    az spring gateway route-config create \
        --service ${SPRING_APPS_SERVICE} \
        --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
        --name ${AI_APP} \
        --app-name ${AI_APP} \
        --routes-file azure-spring-apps-enterprise/resources/json/routes/assist-service.json
    ```
    
1. Deploy the application, e.g. 

    ```bash
    az spring app deploy --name ${AI_APP} \
        --service ${SPRING_APPS_SERVICE} \
        --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
        --source-path apps/acme-assist \
        --build-env BP_JVM_VERSION=17 \
        --env \
            SPRING_AI_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=${SPRING_AI_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT} \
            SPRING_AI_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=${SPRING_AI_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY} \
            SPRING_AI_AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL=${SPRING_AI_AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL} \
            SPRING_AI_AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDINGMODEL=${SPRING_AI_AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDINGMODEL}
    ```

1. Test the `acme-fitness` application in the browser again. Go to `ASK TO FITASSIST` and converse with the assistant, e.g.

   ```
   I need a bike for a commute to work.
   ```

1. Observe the output that was generated by the Assist application, e.g.
