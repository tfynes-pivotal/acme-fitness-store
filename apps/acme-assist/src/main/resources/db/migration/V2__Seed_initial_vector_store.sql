Connect with SwiftSync App

description: ## Overview
Make tubeless setup a breeze with the Zephyr AirCharge Floor Pump. This innovative bike accessory combines the functionality of a floor pump and a tubeless setup tool, allowing you to easily inflate tubeless ready (TLR) tires at home or on the go. With its user-friendly design and accurate pressure readings, the Zephyr AirCharge Floor Pump is a must-have for any cyclist.

## Product Details
- Dual-chamber design with Inflate setting for traditional floor pump use

## Features
### Dual-Chamber Design
The Zephyr AirCharge Floor Pump features a dual-chamber design that allows it to function as both a traditional floor pump and an air compressor. Switch between the Inflate setting for regular pumping or the Charge setting for pressurized chamber inflation of tubeless tires.

### Tubeless Setup Made Easy

## Features

### All-in-One Pump Solution
The BikeMax InflaCharge eliminates the need for multiple pumps or additional tools. Its dual-chamber design allows it to function as both a standard floor pump and a tubeless setup tool, making it a versatile accessory for all your inflation needs.

### Tubeless Tire Setup Made Easy
Say goodbye to the hassle of using bulky air compressors for seating tubeless tires. The InflaCharge\'s "Charge" setting pressurizes a chamber, which can be quickly released to seat tubeless tire beads on a rim. This innovative feature simplifies the tubeless setup process.

### Accurate Pressure Readings
The backlit digital gauge provides easy-to-read and precise pressure measurements up to 160 PSI. This ensures that you achieve the optimal tire pressure for a smooth and efficient ride.

### Convenient Handle Storage
No more searching for misplaced attachments! The InflaCharge\'s handle-integrated storage keeps all the inflation accessories secure and easily accessible. Whether you need to inflate basketballs, pool toys, or other items, you\'ll always know where to find the necessary attachments.

### Pump Up with Confidence
When inflating tubeless tires, reaching the recommended pressure is crucial. The InflaCharge\'s digital gauge signals you\'re ready to go by displaying three dashes on the screen once the chamber reaches the maximum 160 PSI. This feature provides peace of mind and ensures a secure tubeless setup.
